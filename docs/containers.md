# Gunslinger Containers
This document shows off all available containers and data structures in gunslinger.

## Dynamic Array

Gunslinger provides a dynamic array in the form of `gs_dyn_array` and is inspired GREATLY from Shawn Barret's [stretchy buffer]() implementation. `gs_dyn_array` is a generic, dynamic array of type T, 
which is defined by the user:

```c
gs_dyn_array(float) arr = NULL;  // Dyanmic array of type float
```

## Hash Table

## Slot Array

## Slot Map

## Byte Buffer

## Command Buffer
